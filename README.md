## Contributing

A new metric should normally be in its own file in the src/dist directory. There should be a corresponding test file in test/dist.  
The metric should be then added in the exports of src/index.js with a relatively small but understandable name (use camelCase).  
It should also be added to this README with either a link to the formula or an inline description.

## Test

```js
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
